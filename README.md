# ðŸ§  The Meaning Lab â€“ A Philosophy Landing Page

The Meaning Lab is a static landing page centered around the timeless ideas of philosophy, created as my first web development project. Built with only HTML and CSS, the page offers a structured and thoughtful presentation of philosophical themes, thinkers, and inspiration.
From bold headlines and an embedded video, to key philosophical perspectives and motivational quotes, the design aims to spark curiosity and self-reflection â€” all while helping me learn the basics of front-end development.

## âœ¨ Features

- Clean design using pure HTML & CSS
- A hero section with a headline, description, and sign-up CTA
- Embedded YouTube video on philosophical ideas
- Overview of four major philosophical schools: Absurdism, Nihilism, Stoicism, and Existentialism

This project combines my passion for philosophy with my goal of learning web development. Itâ€™s a personal milestone where I practiced writing HTML and CSS, structuring a layout, and crafting content with meaning and clarity.
